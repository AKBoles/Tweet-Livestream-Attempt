# Tweet-Livestream-Attempt
An application that will be used to begin a live-streaming cloud project. This will be used to learn more about the methods required for this to be accomplished.

Note: the file "auth.py" is also required but not shown here as each user will have their own authentication keys provided to them by Twitter. These files should not be shared to others.

Python Files:
  -"send_input_tweet.py": The user types their desired tweet into the command line and if the tweet is less than 140 characters in length, it is tweeted.
    Example call --> python send_input_tweet.py User tweet text goes here.
